which i use often.

This is a collection is utilities and functions, which i personally use in my
projects, shifting them into a lib helps me not reinvent the wheel every time.

* LowerCase and UpperCase
* LeftTrim and RightTrim and Trim
* FrontFill and BackFill
* ReplaceAll

vector of string related:
* SplitStr

number conversion to string or vice versa
 * IntToStr

- About Library Versioning                                                     -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This library uses a three number version numbering, following to what i under-
stand as "reasonable versioning rules".
The rule of thumb is here:

    version = MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

example: 1.0.0


MAJOR increased -> an API-incompatible change was introduced. Installing the lib
                   may break installed packages using the old lib.

MINOR increased -> an API-compatible, new functionality was added. It's safe to
                   replace any older version of this lib with a newer one.

PATCH increased -> the API is untouched. An inprovement or bug fix was done. It
                   is recommended to replace older libs with same MAJOR.MINOR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - 1.0.0 first version, for VDR wirbelscan-Plugin 2021.10.xx, LFS parser,
          Sat Table Generator for wirbelscan.

  - 1.1.0 adds ExpToStr() for w_scan_cpp > 20211009, which in turn uses the
          VDR wirbelscan-Plugin above.

  - 1.1.1 merge pull request "Create relative symbolic links for shared library"
          to improve ubuntu build system compat

  - 1.1.2 add 'make dll' target to support mingw64 from msys2.
          This allows to use the lib on WIN32.

Installation:
   make -j8
   sudo make install

If you - by mistake - installed this lib and may want to completely remove it
from your system:
   sudo make uninstall

NOTE: this will remove exactly the files and links this package installed,
      not those from newer or older versions.
      However, this may break links overwritten by 'make install' of any other
      version of this lib.


Library update:
  Find the very last installed source of this lib and execute 'make uninstall'.
  Continue with Installation Process of the newer lib.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- mingw64 on WIN32                                                             -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation (in mingw64 window):
   make dll

After that, you copy the dll and header to their destinations. Suggestion for
a possible 'make install-dll' target where to put the dll and header are welcome.

Linking to the lib is done by adding
   -l:librepfunc.dll 
to your programs Makefile.
